- ✅ Icons from lucide-react for better UX

#### Features Implemented
1. **Vault List**: Displays all active Pendle vaults with key metrics
2. **Liquidity Filter**: Slider to filter vaults by USD liquidity (not volume as originally planned, since liquidity is more relevant)
3. **Vault Cards**: Show name, expiry, liquidity, and implied APY
4. **Vault Details Modal**: Click any vault to view detailed information including:
   - Market information (chain ID, expiry)
   - Liquidity & volume metrics
   - Yield information (implied APY, underlying APY, LP APY)
   - Token prices (PT and YT)
   - Raw API data for advanced users
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

#### Technical Details
- Pendle API endpoint: https://api-v2.pendle.finance/core/v1/{chain_id}/markets/active
- Default chain: Ethereum mainnet (chain_id=1)
- Filter based on liquidity (TVL) rather than volume for better market discovery

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED AND DEPLOYED
